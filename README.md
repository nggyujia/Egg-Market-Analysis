# When Can You Save the Most on Eggs?
This project is part of the [Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is an exploratory data analysis of egg prices in the U.S. It practices gathering data and performing analysis to answer questions that are of the interest of stakeholders. In this case, the post is intended for audience with an interest in consumer trends and want to find out more on commodity market changes in eggs. It follows the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) guideline by understanding the problem and data, preparing the data, selecting the approapriate methods to analyze, and communiting the analysis results to others.

## Installation

The project is written in Python in Jupyter Notebook. You can see the analysis in (When Can You Save the Most on Eggs?.ipynb)[https://github.com/nggyujia/Egg-Market-Analysis/blob/master/When%20Can%20You%20Save%20the%20Most%20on%20Eggs%3F.ipynb]. No extra installation is needed to access the analysis.

## Data

The data in the Jupyter notebook are extracted through the USDA NASS API. There are three data tables extracted:
1. Number of total layers (egg laying chickens)
2. National egg prices
3. State egg prices

## Business Questions

The post explores the fluctuations of egg prices across time, therefore line plots are used. It also explores the possible factors affecting/correlating with the changes in the egg prices, therefore incorporating the number of total layers. What can be done more is to check other possible factors, such as corn and soy bean meal prices as these are generally used as chicken feeds, as well as data from the demand side. However, not many grocery stores collect data in a systematic way, so there could be difficulty obtaining data indicating the consumers' demand of eggs. Eggs are also used in bakeries and further processed to other egg products such as liquid egg, adding another layer of difficulty of obtaining demand data. It would be interesting to see the influence of both supply and demand on the egg market and check if it follows the law of supply and demand in Economics. With more data exploration, a future project could be market prediction with relevant factors, and this would provide great value to the egg industry.
